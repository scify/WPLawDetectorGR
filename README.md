# WordPress Law Detector Plugin (a.k.a. WPLawDetectorGR)
## Overview
This wordpress or WP (https://wordpress.org/) plugin is meant to to identify references to greek laws and annotate the corresponding article with a direct reference to the online version of the law. 

## Related work
It is mostly based upon the work done in the DemocracIT project (http://demo.democracit.org/ or http://democracit.org/) and especially the entity extractor annotator (https://github.com/scify/Democracit-annotators-entityExtractor).

## Draft Roadmap
The roadmap (without dates) of the project is as follows:
- Initialize processing and detection code.
- Create WP plugin file structure.
- Embed processing and detection code as part of an appropriate (display/render?) hook.
- Add administration options.

## How-to Install
TODO (Should be compliant with the normal WordPress plugin installation when finished.)

## Thanks
Many thanks to the WildPointers team for making this happen.
